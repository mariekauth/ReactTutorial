# ReactTutorial
Path to learning React

Pupose:
The purpose of this project is to show a path to understanding what a React Application is doing.
I previously followed the tutorial for creating an Angular Application and creating a React Application

You can find the React tutorial here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Then it came time to update all the outdated node packages in an existing React application, along with all the code as necessary. Without a solid base in React and completely understanding what it was doing, I found this quite challenging.

To rectify this situation, I have decided to study React and learn the basics from the ground up, I felt it would be beneficial to document the learning path taken to achieve this goal. I feel that this will be the easiest way for me to retain the knowledge, and look back as needed. As well as provide a benefit to anybody else who is interested in learning to create a React application.

What will be created: The completed project will be Developer Toolbox

It is a simple list of developer tools. Each tool will have the following properties:
 - name
 - description
 - purpose (optional)
 - where to get (url to either download or learn)
 - into (optional, may contain more information regarding a specific tool)
 - dependencies (optional, a list of dependencies to use this tool)
 
 * Note: The dependencies aren't TRUE dependencies, but having them FIRST will make the next tool that much easier
 
 Time Frame for Completion: 2 weeks
 
 # TOOLS
 - Repository: (Keep the code centralized) - Using Github
 - Project Board: (Track the work items) - Using https://github.com/mariekauth/ReactTutorial/projects
 - CLI (Command Line Interface): To properly interact with our React Application 
 - Git: Versioning the code - In my case will also be using GitBash
 - Node.js
 - npm (Node Package Manager)
 - yarn - Package Manager, will install the node packages in parallel, increasing performance. 
 - vs code (Visual Studio Code): Editor
 
 # Packages
 May update this later with a description of some of the packages, for now look in the project for the packages.
 I will likely be installing them one by one, on an as needed basis.
 Note: Also, I will be trying to encorporate certain packages to meet certain learning criteria even if not explicitly required for this particular project.
